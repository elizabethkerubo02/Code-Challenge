# Three Divs with three challenges below

Student Grade Generator
This program prompts the user to input a student's marks, between 0 and 100, and outputs the corresponding grade. The grade boundaries are defined as follows:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40
To run the program, simply execute the script and follow the prompts to input the student marks. The program will then output the corresponding grade.

Speed Detector
This program takes as input the speed of a car and determines the number of demerit points the driver would receive based on their speed. If the speed is less than 70 km/s, the program outputs "Ok". For speeds greater than or equal to 70 km/s, the program assigns one demerit point for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70 km/s). If the total number of demerit points exceeds 12, the program outputs "License suspended".

To run the program, execute the script and follow the prompts to input the car's speed. The program will then output the corresponding number of demerit points, or "Ok" if no demerit points are assigned.

Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits, and also calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSD deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

To run the program, execute the script and follow the prompts to input the individual's basic salary and benefits. The program will then output the corresponding values for payee, NHIF deductions, NSSD deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

Project Setup
To use these programs, simply download the script files and execute them in a Javascript environment. These programs require no additional dependencies.
